Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: fix TDS for MTK xHCI1.1
Git-commit: 72b663a99c074a8d073e7ecdae446cfb024ef551
Patch-mainline: v4.15
References: bsc#1085539

For MTK's xHCI 1.0 or latter, TD size is the number of max
packet sized packets remaining in the TD, not including
this TRB (following spec).

For MTK's xHCI 0.96 and older, TD size is the number of max
packet sized packets remaining in the TD, including this TRB
(not following spec).
