Subject: [PATCH] mm, page_alloc: drop should_suppress_show_mem
Git-commit: 2c029a1ea3aac296cd5b47584a579defcc4b4aa0
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1 
References: bnc#1125892, bnc#1106061

should_suppress_show_mem() was introduced to reduce the overhead of
show_mem on large NUMA systems.  Things have changed since then though.
Namely c78e93630d15 ("mm: do not walk all of system memory during
show_mem") has reduced the overhead considerably.

Moreover warn_alloc_show_mem clears SHOW_MEM_FILTER_NODES when called from
the IRQ context already so we are not printing per node stats.

Remove should_suppress_show_mem because we are losing potentially
interesting information about allocation failures.  We have seen a bug
report where system gets unresponsive under memory pressure and there is
only

Kernel: [2032243.696888] qlge 0000:8b:00.1 ql1: Could not get a page chunk, i=8, clean_idx =200 .
Kernel: [2032243.710725] swapper/7: page allocation failure: order:1, mode:0x1084120(GFP_ATOMIC|__GFP_COLD|__GFP_COMP)

without an additional information for debugging.  It would be great to see
the state of the page allocator at the moment.
