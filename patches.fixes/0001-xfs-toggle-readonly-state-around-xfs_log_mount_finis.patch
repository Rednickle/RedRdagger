Subject: [PATCH] xfs: toggle readonly state around xfs_log_mount_finish
Git-commit: 6f4a1eefdd0ad4561543270a7fceadabcca075dd
Patch-mainline: v4.14
References: bsc#1073401

When we do log recovery on a readonly mount, unlinked inode
processing does not happen due to the readonly checks in
xfs_inactive(), which are trying to prevent any I/O on a
readonly mount.

This is misguided - we do I/O on readonly mounts all the time,
for consistency; for example, log recovery.  So do the same
RDONLY flag twiddling around xfs_log_mount_finish() as we
do around xfs_log_mount(), for the same reason.

This all cries out for a big rework but for now this is a
simple fix to an obvious problem.
