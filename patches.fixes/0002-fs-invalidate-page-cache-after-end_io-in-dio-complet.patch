Subject: [PATCH 2/3] fs: invalidate page cache after end_io() in dio
 completion
Git-commit: 5e25c269e17de4c5a23ce886cda612b01365a944
Patch-mainline: v4.14
References: bsc#1073407 bsc#1069135

Commit 332391a9935d ("fs: Fix page cache inconsistency when mixing
buffered and AIO DIO") moved page cache invalidation from
iomap_dio_rw() to iomap_dio_complete() for iomap based direct write
path, but before the dio->end_io() call, and it re-introdued the bug
fixed by commit c771c14baa33 ("iomap: invalidate page caches should
be after iomap_dio_complete() in direct write").

I found this because fstests generic/418 started failing on XFS with
v4.14-rc3 kernel, which is the regression test for this specific
bug.

So similarly, fix it by moving dio->end_io() (which does the
unwritten extent conversion) before page cache invalidation, to make
sure next buffer read reads the final real allocations not unwritten
extents. I also add some comments about why should end_io() go first
in case we get it wrong again in the future.

Note that, there's no such problem in the non-iomap based direct
write path, because we didn't remove the page cache invalidation
after the ->direct_IO() in generic_file_direct_write() call, but I
decided to fix dio_complete() too so we don't leave a landmine
there, also be consistent with iomap_dio_complete().
