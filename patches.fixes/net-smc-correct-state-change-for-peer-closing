Subject: net/smc: correct state change for peer closing
Git-commit: 84b799a292ebc03de388f8573a169de6eb12c340
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc6
References: bsc#1129861 LTC#176250

If some kind of closing is received from the peer while still in
state SMC_INIT, it means the peer has had an active connection and
closed the socket quickly before listen_work finished. This should
not result in a shortcut from state SMC_INIT to state SMC_CLOSED.
This patch adds the socket to the accept queue in state
SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT1. The socket reaches state SMC_CLOSED once being
accepted and closed with smc_release().
