Subject: libfc: Issue PRLI after a PRLO has been received
References: bsc#962846
Patch-Mainline: submitted to linux-scsi, 2016/08/18

When receiving a PRLO it just means that the operating parameters
have changed, it does _not_ mean that the port doesn't want to
communicate with us.
So instead of implicitly logging out we should be issueing a PRLI
to figure out the new operating parameters.
We can always recover once PRLI fails.
