Subject: [PATCH 12/77] xfs: don't set XFS_BTCUR_BPRV_WASDEL in xfs_bunmapi
Git-commit: b213d69293cf003e6f0c63adfee6fcc70e3afee6
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: bsc#1095344

The XFS_BTCUR_BPRV_WASDEL flag is supposed to indicate that we are
converting a delayed allocation to a real one, which isn't the case
in xfs_bunmapi.  Setting it could theoretically lead to misaccounting
here, but it's unlikely that we ever hit it in practice.
