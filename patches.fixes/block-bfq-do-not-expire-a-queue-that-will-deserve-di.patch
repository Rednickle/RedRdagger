Subject: [PATCH] block, bfq: do not expire a queue that will deserve dispatch

For some bfq_queues, BFQ plugs I/O dispatching when the queue becomes
idle, and keeps the plug until a new request of the queue arrives, or
a timeout fires. BFQ does so either to boost throughput or to preserve
service guarantees for the queue.

More precisely, for such a queue, plugging starts when the queue
happens to have either no request enqueued, or no request in flight,
that is, no request already dispatched but not yet completed.

On the opposite end, BFQ may happen to expire a queue with no request
enqueued, without doing any plugging, if the queue still has some
request in flight. Unfortunately, such a premature expiration causes
the queue to lose its chance to enjoy dispatch plugging a moment
later, i.e., when its in-flight requests finally get completed. This
breaks service guarantees for the queue.

This commit prevents BFQ from expiring an empty queue if the latter
still has in-flight requests.
