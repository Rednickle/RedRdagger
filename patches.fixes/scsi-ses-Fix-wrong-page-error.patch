Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ses: Fix wrong page error
References: bsc#1061782
Git-commit: 424f727b94132a4193af401dd823c44612d1d59f
Patch-Mainline: v4.13-rc6

If a SES device returns an error on a requested diagnostic page, we are
currently printing an error indicating the wrong page was received. Fix
this up to simply return a failure and only check the returned page when
the diagnostic page buffer was populated by the device.
