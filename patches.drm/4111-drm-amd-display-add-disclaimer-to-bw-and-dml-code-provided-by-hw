Subject: drm/amd/display: Add disclaimer to BW and DML code provided by HW
Git-commit: a018298ff850effd3a8494c839449150aef0934a
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

This code can sometimes look troubling but we trust it as it comes from
HW teams with a guarantee of correctness. Add a note to these files to
explain this.

v2: thing -> things
