Subject: [PATCH 16/20] arm64: vgic-v2: Fix proxying of cpuif access

Git-commit: b220244d41798c6592e7d17843256eb0bae456a0
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc4
References: bsc#1106901

Proxying the cpuif accesses at EL2 makes use of vcpu_data_guest_to_host
and co, which check the endianness, which call into vcpu_read_sys_reg...
which isn't mapped at EL2 (it was inlined before, and got moved OoL
with the VHE optimizations).

The result is of course a nice panic. Let's add some specialized
cruft to keep the broken platforms that require this hack alive.

But, this code used vcpu_data_guest_to_host(), which expected us to
write the value to host memory, instead we have trapped the guest's
read or write to an mmio-device, and are about to replay it using the
host's readl()/writel() which also perform swabbing based on the host
endianness. This goes wrong when both host and guest are big-endian,
as readl()/writel() will undo the guest's swabbing, causing the
big-endian value to be written to device-memory.

What needs doing?
A big-endian guest will have pre-swabbed data before storing, undo this.
If its necessary for the host, writel() will re-swab it.

For a read a big-endian guest expects to swab the data after the load.
The hosts's readl() will correct for host endianness, giving us the
device-memory's value in the register. For a big-endian guest, swab it
as if we'd only done the load.

For a little-endian guest, nothing needs doing as readl()/writel() leave
the correct device-memory value in registers.

Tested on Juno with that rarest of things: a big-endian 64K host.
Based on a patch from Marc Zyngier.
