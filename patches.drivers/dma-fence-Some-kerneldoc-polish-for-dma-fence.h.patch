Subject: [PATCH] dma-fence: Some kerneldoc polish for dma-fence.h
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 2c269b090651234203c2f74af059a19f98ed101d
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: bsc#794563

- Switch to inline member docs for dma_fence_ops.
- Mild polish all around.
- hyperlink all the things!

V2: - Remove the various [in] annotations, they seem really uncommon
in kerneldoc and look funny.

V3: Linebreak the "Returns" part of the @fill_driver_data kerneldoc
(Eric).

- * Calling dma_fence_signal before enable_signaling is called allows

- * that before enable_signaling returns true an extra reference is
- * taken on the fence, to be released when the fence is signaled.

- * Notes on wait:
- * Must not be NULL, set to dma_fence_default_wait for default implementation.

- *
- * Must return -ERESTARTSYS if the wait is intr = true and the wait was

- * timed out. Can also return other error values on custom implementations,
- * which should be treated as if the fence is signaled. For example a hardware
