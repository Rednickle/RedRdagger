Subject: hpsa: allow hpsa to claim Compaq SmartArray devices
Patch-mainline: Submitted to linux-scsi (and maintainer), 8 Apr 2014
References: bnc#869383

The hpsa driver has a wildcard entry to support older HP SmartArray devices
as unsupported. There are devices still in use that bear the Compaq vendor
ID and should be handled as well. These devices will be handled only when
hpsa_allow_any is set.

Tested with a device matching:
        {PCI_VENDOR_ID_COMPAQ, PCI_DEVICE_ID_COMPAQ_CISSC, 0x0E11, 0x4091}
