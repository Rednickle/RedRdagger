Subject: [PATCH] APEI / ERST: Fix missing error handling in erst_reader()
Date: Thu, 14 Dec 2017 13:31:16 +0100
Message-id: <20171214123116.929-1-tiwai@suse.de>
Patch-mainline: Submitted, linux-acpi ML
References: bsc#1072556

The commit f6f828513290 ("pstore: pass allocated memory region back to
caller") changed the check of the return value from erst_read() in
erst_reader() in the following way:

        if (len == -ENOENT)
                goto skip;
-       else if (len < 0) {
-               rc = -1;
+       else if (len < sizeof(*rcd)) {
+               rc = -EIO;
                goto out;

This introduced another bug: since the comparison with sizeof() is
cast to unsigned, a negative len value doesn't hit any longer.
As a result, when an error is returned from erst_read(), the code
falls through, and it may eventually lead to some weird thing like
memory corruption.

This patch adds the negative error value check more explicitly for
addressing the issue.
