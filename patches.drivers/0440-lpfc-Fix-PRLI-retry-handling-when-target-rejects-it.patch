Subject: lpfc: Fix PRLI retry handling when target rejects it.
References: bsc#1041873
Patch-Mainline: submitted linux-scsi 2017/06/01

The nvmet driver was rejecting the initiator's PRLI because
its reg_rpi for the PLOGI was still outstanding.  The initiator
would resend the PRLI without delay and get the same answer.
The PRLI retries would exhaust causing the nvme initiator to
set the nvmet ndlp to UNMAPPED.

The driver's lpfc_els_retry handler did not have a policy for an
LS_RJT with explanation CMD_IN_PROGRESS for PRLI or NVME_PRLI.
This caused the delay to remain at 0 but retry set 1.

Fix: When the ELS response is LS_RJT, TPC and the command was PRLI
or NVME_PRLI, just set the delay to 1000 mS to get a 1 second
delay on the PRLI retry.  This was enough to allow the REG_RPI to
complete at the target.
