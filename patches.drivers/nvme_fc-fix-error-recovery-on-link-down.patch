Subject: nvme_fc: fix error recovery on link down.
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
Git-commit: 69fa964632fe18a11a80ead0d09ef3399b08144a
References: FATE#323952, FATE#322506

Currently, the fc transport invokes nvme_fc_error_recovery() on every
io in which the transport detects an error.  Which means:
a) it's really noisy on large io loads that all get hit by a link down.
b) we repeatively call nvme_stop_queues() even though queues are
 stopped upon the first error or as first steps of reset_work.

Correct by:
Errors are only meaningful if the controller is in the LIVE state.
Thus, enact the reset_work only if LIVE. If called repeatively, state
will have already transitioned.
There's no need to stop the queues here. Let the first steps of
reset_work do the queue stopping.
