Subject: [PATCH 1/5] dt-bindings: Add binding for brcm,bcm2835-sdhost.
Patch-mainline: Submitted, http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mmc/msg37743.html
References: bsc#983145

This is the other SD controller on the platform, which can be swapped
to the role of SD card host using pin muxing.

+Broadcom BCM2835 SDHOST controller
+
+This file documents differences between the core properties described
+by mmc.txt and the properties that represent the BCM2835 controller.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: Should be "brcm,bcm2835-sdhci".
+- clocks: The clock feeding the SDHOST controller.
+
+Optional properties:
+- dmas: DMA channels for read and write.
+          See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt for details
+
+Example:
+
+sdhost: sdhost@7e202000 {
+	compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-sdhost";
+	reg = <0x7e202000 0x100>;
+	interrupts = <2 24>;
+	clocks = <&clocks BCM2835_CLOCK_VPU>;
+	dmas = <&dma 13>,
+	       <&dma 13>;
+	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
+};
