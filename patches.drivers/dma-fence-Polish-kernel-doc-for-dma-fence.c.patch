Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: bsc#794563

- Intro section that links to how this is exposed to userspace.
- Lots more hyperlinks.
- Minor clarifications and style polish

V2: Add misplaced hunk of kerneldoc from a different patch.

+/**
+ * DOC: DMA fences overview
+ *
+ * DMA fences, represented by &struct dma_fence, are the kernel internal
+ * synchronization primitive for DMA operations like GPU rendering, video
+ * encoding/decoding, or displaying buffers on a screen.
+ *
+ * A fence is initialized using dma_fence_init() and completed using
+ * dma_fence_signal(). Fences are associated with a context, allocated through
+ * dma_fence_context_alloc(), and all fences on the same context are
+ * fully ordered.
+ *
+ * Since the purposes of fences is to facilitate cross-device and
+ * cross-application synchronization, there's multiple ways to use one:
+ *
+ * - Individual fences can be exposed as a &sync_file, accessed as a file
+ *   descriptor from userspace, created by calling sync_file_create(). This is
+ *   called explicit fencing, since userspace passes around explicit
+ *   synchronization points.
+ *
+ * - Some subsystems also have their own explicit fencing primitives, like
+ *   &drm_syncobj. Compared to &sync_file, a &drm_syncobj allows the underlying
+ *   fence to be updated.
+ *
+ * - Then there's also implicit fencing, where the synchronization points are
+ *   implicitly passed around as part of shared &dma_buf instances. Such
+ *   implicit fences are stored in &struct reservation_object through the
+ *   &dma_buf.resv pointer.
