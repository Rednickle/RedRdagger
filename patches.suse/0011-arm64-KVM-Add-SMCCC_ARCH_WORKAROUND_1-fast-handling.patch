Subject: arm64: KVM: Add SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 fast handling
Git-commit: f72af90c3783d924337624659b43e2d36f1b36b4
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1068032

We want SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 to be fast. As fast as possible.
So let's intercept it as early as we can by testing for the
function call number as soon as we've identified a HVC call
coming from the guest.
