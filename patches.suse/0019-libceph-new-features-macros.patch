+ * Notes on deprecation:
+ *
+ * A *major* release is a release through which all upgrades must pass
+ * (e.g., jewel).  For example, no pre-jewel server will ever talk to
+ * a post-jewel server (mon, osd, etc).
+ *
+ * For feature bits used *only* on the server-side:
+ *
+ *  - In the first phase we indicate that a feature is DEPRECATED as of
+ *    a particular release.  This is the first major release X (say,
+ *    jewel) that does not depend on its peers advertising the feature.
+ *    That is, it safely assumes its peers all have the feature.  We
+ *    indicate this with the DEPRECATED macro.  For example,
+ *
+ *      DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE_DEPRECATED( 2, 1, MONCLOCKCHECK, JEWEL)
+ *
+ *    because 10.2.z (jewel) did not care if its peers advertised this
+ *    feature bit.
+ *
+ *  - In the second phase we stop advertising the the bit and call it
+ *    RETIRED.  This can normally be done in the *next* major release
+ *    following the one in which we marked the feature DEPRECATED.  In
+ *    the above example, for 12.0.z (luminous) we can say:
+ *
+ *      DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE_RETIRED( 2, 1, MONCLOCKCHECK, JEWEL, LUMINOUS)
+ *
+ *  - The bit can be reused in the first post-luminous release, 13.0.z
+ *    (m).
+ *
+ * This ensures that no two versions who have different meanings for
+ * the bit ever speak to each other.
