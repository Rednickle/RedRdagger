Subject: printk: Make printk() completely async
Patch-mainline: No, still being discussed upstream
References: bnc#744692, bnc#789311

Currently, printk() sometimes waits for message to be printed to console
and sometimes it does not (when console_sem is held by some other
process). In case printk() grabs console_sem and starts printing to
console, it prints messages from kernel printk buffer until the buffer
is empty. When serial console is attached, printing is slow and thus
other CPUs in the system have plenty of time to append new messages to
the buffer while one CPU is printing. Thus the CPU can spend unbounded
amount of time doing printing in console_unlock().  This is especially
serious problem if the printk() calling console_unlock() was called with
interrupts disabled.

In practice users have observed a CPU can spend tens of seconds printing
in console_unlock() (usually during boot when hundreds of SCSI devices
are discovered) resulting in RCU stalls (CPU doing printing doesn't
reach quiescent state for a long time), softlockup reports (IPIs for the
printing CPU don't get served and thus other CPUs are spinning waiting
for the printing CPU to process IPIs), and eventually a machine death
(as messages from stalls and lockups append to printk buffer faster than
we are able to print). So these machines are unable to boot with serial
console attached. Another observed issue is that due to slow printk,
hardware discovery is slow and udev times out before kernel manages to
discover all the attached HW. Also during artificial stress testing SATA
disk disappears from the system because its interrupts aren't served for
too long.

This patch makes printk() completely asynchronous (similar to what
printk_deferred() did until now). It appends message to the kernel
printk buffer and wake_up()s a special dedicated kthread to do the
printing to console. This has the advantage that printing always happens
from a schedulable contex and thus we don't lockup any particular CPU or
even interrupts. Also it has the advantage that printk() is fast and
thus kernel booting is not slowed down by slow serial console.
Disadvantage of this method is that in case of crash there is higher
chance that important messages won't appear in console output (we may
need working scheduling to print message to console). We somewhat
mitigate this risk by switching printk to the original method of
immediate printing to console if oops is in progress.

Async printk, for the time being, is considered to be less reliable
than the synchronous one, so by default we keep printk operating in
synchronous mode. There is a printk.synchronous kernel parameter which
permits to select sync/async mode as a boot parameter or later on
from user space via sysfs knob.

printk() is expected to work under different conditions and in different
scenarios, including corner cases of OOM when all of the workers are busy
(e.g. allocating memory), thus printk() uses its own dedicated printing
kthread, rather than relying on workqueue (even with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM bit
set we potentially can receive delays in printing until workqueue
declares a ->mayday, as noted by Tetsuo Handa).
