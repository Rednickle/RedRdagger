Subject: [PATCH 17/17] NFS: nfs4_lookup_revalidate need to report STALE
 inodes.
Patch-mainline: submitted 2014-07-24
References: bnc#866130

If an 'open' of a file in an NFSv4 filesystem finds that the dentry is
in cache, but the inode is stale (on the server), the dentry will not
be re-validated immediately and may cause ESTALE to be returned to
user-space.

For a non-create 'open', do_last() calls lookup_fast() and on success
will eventually call may_open() which calls into nfs_permission().
If nfs_permission() makes the ACCESS call to the server it will get
NFS4ERR_STALE, resulting in ESTALE from may_open() and thence from
do_last().
The retry-on-ESTALE in filename_lookup() will repeat exactly the same
process because nothing in this path will invalidate the dentry if the
inode is stale, so the ESTALE will be returned.

lookup_fast() calls ->d_revalidate(), but for an OPEN on an NFSv4
filesystem, that will succeed for regular files:
	/* Let f_op->open() actually open (and revalidate) the file */

Unfortunately in the case of a STALE inode, f_op->open() never gets
called.  If we teach nfs4_lookup_revalidate() to report a failure on
NFS_STALE() inodes, then the dentry will be invalidated and a full
lookup will be attempted.


While I think this fix is correct, I'm not convinced that it is
sufficient, particularly if lookupcache=none.
The current code will fail an "open" is nfs_permission() fails,
without having performed a LOOKUP.
nfs_lookup_revalidate will force a lookup before the permission check
if NFS_MOUNT_LOOKUP_CACHE_NONE, but nfs4_lookup_revalidate will not.
