Subject: team: Add vlan tx offload to hw_enc_features
Git-commit: 227f2f030e28d8783c3d10ce70ff4ba79cad653f
Patch-mainline: 5.3-rc6
References: bsc#1051510 networking-stable-19_08_21

We should also enable team's vlan tx offload in hw_enc_features,
pass the vlan packets to the slave devices with vlan tci, let the
slave handle vlan tunneling offload implementation.

Fixes: 3268e5cb494d ("team: Advertise tunneling offload features")
