Subject: scsi: qedf: Stop sending fipvlan request on unload
Git-commit: 4909e153e608360702ad34f76f72190bfaec3d9d
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1149976

 - On some setups fipvlan can be retried for long duration and the
   connection to switch was not there so it was not getting any reply.

 - During unload this thread was hanging.

Problem Resolution:

Check if unload is in progress, then quit from fipvlan thread.
