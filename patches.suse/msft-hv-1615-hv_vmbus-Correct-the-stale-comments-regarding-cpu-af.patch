  * Starting with Win8, we can statically distribute the incoming

- * We do this in a hierarchical fashion:
- * First distribute the primary channels across available NUMA nodes
- * and then distribute the subchannels amongst the CPUs in the NUMA
- * node assigned to the primary channel.
+ * We distribute the interrupt loads to one or more NUMA nodes based on

  * For pre-win8 hosts or non-performance critical channels we assign the
  * first CPU in the first NUMA node.
