Subject: [PATCH] bcache: set CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE in bch_cached_dev_error()
Git-commit: 6147305c73e4511ca1a975b766b97a779d442567
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc4
References: bsc#1093023

Commit c7b7bd07404c5 ("bcache: add io_disable to struct cached_dev") tries
to stop bcache device by calling bcache_device_stop() when too many I/O
errors happened on backing device. But if there is internal I/O happening
on cache device (writeback scan, garbage collection, etc), a regular I/O
request triggers the internal I/Os may still holds a refcount of dc->count,
and the refcount may only be dropped after the internal I/O stopped.

By this patch, bch_cached_dev_error() will check if the backing device is
attached to a cache set, if yes that CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE will be set to
flags of this cache set. Then internal I/Os on cache device will be
rejected and stopped immediately, and the bcache device can be stopped.

For people who are not familiar with the interesting refcount dependance,
let me explain a bit more how the fix works. Example the writeback thread
will scan cache device for dirty data writeback purpose. Before it stopps,
it holds a refcount of dc->count. When CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE bit is set,
the internal I/O will stopped and the while-loop in bch_writeback_thread()
quits and calls cached_dev_put() to drop dc->count. If this is the last
refcount to drop, then cached_dev_detach_finish() will be called. In this
call back function, in turn closure_put(dc->disk.cl) is called to drop a
refcount of closure dc->disk.cl. If this is the last refcount of this
closure to drop, then cached_dev_flush() will be called. Then the cached
device is freed. So if CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE is not set, the bache device
can not be stopped until all inernal cache device I/O stopped. For large
size cache device, and writeback thread competes locks with gc thread,
there might be a quite long time to wait.
