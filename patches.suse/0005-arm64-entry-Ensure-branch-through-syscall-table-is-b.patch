Subject: arm64: entry: Ensure branch through syscall table is bounded under
 speculation
Git-commit: 6314d90e64936c584f300a52ef173603fb2461b5
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1068032

In a similar manner to array_index_mask_nospec, this patch introduces an
assembly macro (mask_nospec64) which can be used to bound a value under
speculation. This macro is then used to ensure that the indirect branch
through the syscall table is bounded under speculation, with out-of-range
addresses speculating as calls to sys_io_setup (0).
