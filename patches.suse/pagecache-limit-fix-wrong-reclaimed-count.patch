Subject: pagecache limit: fix wrong nr_reclaimed count
Patch-mainline: never
References: FATE#309111, bnc#924701

During development of tracepoints for pagecache limit reclaim, it was found out
that the total accumulated nr_reclaimed count in __shrink_page_cache() stored
in variable "ret" can be higher than the real value when more than one
shrink_all_zones() passes are performed during the reclaim. This happens
because shrink_all_zones() uses sc.nr_reclaimed to accumulate work from all
passes, but __shrink_page_cache() assumes the value corresponds to a single
pass and performs own accumulation in the "ret" variable. This may result in
multiple accumulation and thus premature exits from __shrink_page_cache()
instead of retrying with higher priority as intended.

The issue is limited in practice, as the number of pages to reclaim is
capped at 8*SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX anyway. However, the implementation should work
as intended, and we want to report the accumulated count in a tracepoint, so
it should be corrected also to allow proper performance analysis.

The patch fixes the issue by removing the accumulation in shrink_all_zones()
and leaving it only __shrink_page_cache() where it is needed. After the patch
shrink_all_zones() will set sc->nr_reclaimed according to how much was
reclaimed during a single call of the function.
