Subject: [PATCH] printk/console: Always disable boot consoles that use init
 memory before it is freed
Git-commit: 2b1be689f3aadcfe0a768314c80e43483c784659
References: bsc#1063026
Patch-Mainline: v4.14-rc1

Commit 4c30c6f566c0 ("kernel/printk: do not turn off bootconsole in
printk_late_init() if keep_bootcon") added a check on keep_bootcon to
ensure that boot consoles were kept around until the real console is
registered.

This can lead to problems if the boot console data and code are in the
init section, since it can be freed before the boot console is
unregistered.

Commit 81cc26f2bd11 ("printk: only unregister boot consoles when
necessary") fixed this a better way. It allowed to keep boot consoles
that did not use init data. Unfortunately it did not remove the check
of keep_bootcon.

This can lead to crashes and weird panics when the bootconsole is
accessed after free, especially if page poisoning is in use and the
code / data have been overwritten with a poison value.

To prevent this, always free the boot console if it is within the init
section. In addition, print a warning about that the console is removed
prematurely.

Finally there is a new comment how to avoid the warning. It replaced
an explanation that duplicated a more comprehensive function
description few lines above.
