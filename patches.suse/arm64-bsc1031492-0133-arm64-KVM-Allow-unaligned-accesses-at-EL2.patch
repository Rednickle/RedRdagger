Subject: [PATCH 133/174] arm64: KVM: Allow unaligned accesses at EL2
Git-commit: 821b22374790a4f9cdd86deae6a1e474f4c55bd9
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm.git kvm-arm-for-v4.12-rc5-take2
References: bsc#1031492

We currently have the SCTLR_EL2.A bit set, trapping unaligned accesses
at EL2, but we're not really prepared to deal with it. So far, this
has been unnoticed, until GCC 7 started emitting those (in particular
64bit writes on a 32bit boundary).

Since the rest of the kernel is pretty happy about that, let's follow
its example and set SCTLR_EL2.A to zero. Modern CPUs don't really
care.
