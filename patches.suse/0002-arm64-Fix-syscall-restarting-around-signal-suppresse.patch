Subject: arm64: Fix syscall restarting around signal suppressed by tracer

Git-commit: 0fe42512b2f03f9e5a20b9f55ef1013a68b4cd48
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: fate#325866

Commit 17c2895 ("arm64: Abstract syscallno manipulation") abstracts
out the pt_regs.syscallno value for a syscall cancelled by a tracer
as NO_SYSCALL, and provides helpers to set and check for this
condition.  However, the way this was implemented has the
unintended side-effect of disabling part of the syscall restart
logic.

This comes about because the second in_syscall() check in
do_signal() re-evaluates the "in a syscall" condition based on the
updated pt_regs instead of the original pt_regs.  forget_syscall()
is explicitly called prior to the second check in order to prevent
restart logic in the ret_to_user path being spuriously triggered,
which means that the second in_syscall() check always yields false.

This triggers a failure in
tools/testing/selftests/seccomp/seccomp_bpf.c, when using ptrace to
suppress a signal that interrups a nanosleep() syscall.

Misbehaviour of this type is only expected in the case where a
tracer suppresses a signal and the target process is either being
single-stepped or the interrupted syscall attempts to restart via
-ERESTARTBLOCK.

This patch restores the old behaviour by performing the
in_syscall() check only once at the start of the function.
