Subject: [PATCH] cifs: add a warning if we try to to dequeue a deleted mid
Git-commit: ddf83afb9f60ee58cdec30bb615eff65d00ba05e
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc7
References: bsc#1144333

cifs_delete_mid() is called once we are finished handling a mid and we
expect no more work done on this mid.

Needed to fix recent commit:
commit 730928c8f4be88e9d6a027a16b1e8fa9c59fc077
("cifs: update smb2_queryfs() to use compounding")

Add a warning if someone tries to dequeue a mid that has already been
flagged to be deleted.
Also change list_del() to list_del_init() so that if we have similar bugs
resurface in the future we will not oops.
