Subject: Drivers: hv: balloon: Show the max dynamic memory assigned
Git-commit: 7b6e54b524b66b60e4cf49e8aa7c43045ebb987d
References: fate#323887

Previously we were only showing max number of pages. We should make it
more clear that this value is the max amount of dynamic memory that the
Hyper-V host is willing to assign to this guest.
