Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Do not migrate due to a sync wakeup on exit

References: bnc#1064414
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc1
Git-commit: 24d0c1d6e65f635b2c0684d0a42ff6c0674aa0e6

From: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>

When a task exits, it notifies the parent that it has exited. This is a
sync wakeup and the exiting task may pull the parent towards the wakers
CPU. For simple workloads like using a shell, it was observed that the
shell is pulled across nodes by exiting processes. This is daft as the
parent may be long-lived and properly placed. This patch special cases a
sync wakeup on exit to avoid pulling tasks across nodes. Testing on a range
of workloads and machines showed very little differences in performance
although there was a small 3% boost on some machines running a shellscript
intensive workload (git regression test suite).
