Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Only wake the waiter from the interrupt if passed
Git-commit: 17b51ad8e5c051032d8e1d698e7dfd01d9133a92
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: FATE#322643 bsc#1055900

As we now check if the seqno is complete in order to signal the fence,
we can also decide not to wake up the first_waiter until it is ready
(since it is waiting on the same seqno). The only caveat is that if we
need the engine->irq_seqno_barrier to enforce some coherency between an
interrupt and the seqno read, we have to always wake the waiter in order
to perform that heavyweight barrier.
