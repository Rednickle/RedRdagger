Subject: KVM: nVMX: Don't flush TLB when vmcs12 uses VPID
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 6f1e03bcabcdbb199940dab0a60b1371cf95f6f9
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: bsc#1106240

Since commit 5c614b3583e7 ("KVM: nVMX: nested VPID emulation"),
vmcs01 and vmcs02 don't share the same VPID. vmcs01 uses vmx->vpid
while vmcs02 uses vmx->nested.vpid02. This was done such that TLB
flush could be avoided when switching between L1 and L2.

However, the above mentioned commit only changed L2 VMEntry logic to
not flush TLB when switching from L1 to L2. It forgot to also remove
the TLB flush which is done when simulating a VMExit from L2 to L1.

To fix this issue, on VMExit from L2 to L1 we flush TLB only in case
vmcs01 enables VPID and vmcs01->vpid==vmcs02->vpid. This happens when
vmcs01 enables VPID and vmcs12 does not.

Fixes: 5c614b3583e7 ("KVM: nVMX: nested VPID emulation")
