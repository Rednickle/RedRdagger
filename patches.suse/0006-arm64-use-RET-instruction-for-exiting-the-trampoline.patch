Subject: [PATCH 06/24] arm64: use RET instruction for exiting the trampoline

Git-commit: be04a6d1126b02c6a28741155b899d648739fc5b
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1068032

Speculation attacks against the entry trampoline can potentially resteer
the speculative instruction stream through the indirect branch and into
arbitrary gadgets within the kernel.

This patch defends against these attacks by forcing a misprediction
through the return stack: a dummy BL instruction loads an entry into
the stack, so that the predicted program flow of the subsequent RET
instruction is to a branch-to-self instruction which is finally resolved
as a branch to the kernel vectors with speculation suppressed.
