Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix leak of ELS completions on adapter reset
Git-commit: 296012285c908f6aacea83913ab9eaf273225d57
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1146215

If the adapter is reset while there are outstanding ELS's, subsequent
reinitialization of the adapter will fail as it has not recovered all of
the io contexts relative to the ELS's.

If an ELS timed out or otherwise failed and an the ELS was attempted to be
aborted (which changes the ELS completion context), in causes where the
driver generates completions for the outstanding IO as the adapter would
not due to being reset, the driver released only the ELS context and failed
to release the abort context.  When the adapter went to reinit, as it had
not received all of the contexts, it failed to reinit.

Fix by having the ELS completion handler identify the driver-generated
completion status and release the abort context.
