Subject: [PATCH] smb3: print tree id in debugdata in proc to be able to help
 logging
Git-commit: e0386e449af3e893cd811c4c932829b981c83817
Patch-mainline: v4.17
References: bsc#1144333

When loooking at the logs for the new trace-cmd tracepoints for cifs,
it would help to know which tid is for which share (UNC name) so
update /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData to display the tid.
Also display Maximal Access which was missing as well.

Now the entry for typical entry for a tcon (in proc/fs/cifs/) looks
like:

1) \\localhost\test Mounts: 1 DevInfo: 0x20 Attributes: 0x1006f
	PathComponentMax: 255 Status: 1 type: DISK
	Share Capabilities: None Aligned, Partition Aligned,	Share Flags: 0x0
	tid: 0xe0632a55	Optimal sector size: 0x200	Maximal Access: 0x1f01ff
