Description:  dasd: fix deadlock in dasd_times_out
Symptom:      System does not respond after disk timeout.
Problem:      The dasd_times_out function processes requests that have an
              internal timeout as well as an external timeout called through
              dasd_ioctl_abortio().
              For the latter type of requests the CQR may be already in a final
              state. The if-else path in dasd_times_out does not handle CQRs in
              the final states DASD_CQR_DONE, DASD_CQR_FAILED and
              DASD_CQR_TERMINATED and therefore the ccw device lock is never
              freed.
Solution:     Provide __dasd_cancel_req that is called with the ccw device lock
              held to simplify the locking in dasd_times_out and fix the
              deadlock issue. Also ensure that interrupts are disabled. The
              function may get called with interrupts enabled or already
              disabled.
Reproduction: Run IO on disks that do not respond to IO requests in a given
              amount of time for example due to hardware failure or reserved
              disk state.
