Subject: x86/bugs, KVM: Extend speculation control for VIRT_SPEC_CTRL
Git-commit: ccbcd2674472a978b48c91c1fbfb66c0ff959f24
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc7
References: bsc#1087082 CVE-2018-3639

AMD is proposing a VIRT_SPEC_CTRL MSR to handle the Speculative Store
Bypass Disable via MSR_AMD64_LS_CFG so that guests do not have to care
about the bit position of the SSBD bit and thus facilitate migration.
Also, the sibling coordination on Family 17H CPUs can only be done on
the host.

Extend x86_spec_ctrl_set_guest() and x86_spec_ctrl_restore_host() with an
extra argument for the VIRT_SPEC_CTRL MSR.

Hand in 0 from VMX and in SVM add a new virt_spec_ctrl member to the CPU
data structure which is going to be used in later patches for the actual
implementation.
