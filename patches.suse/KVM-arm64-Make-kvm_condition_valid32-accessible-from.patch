Subject: KVM: arm64: Make kvm_condition_valid32() accessible from EL2
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
Git-commit: 021234ef3752f853704ef1919e8ff33173aca093
References: bsc#1077761

As we're about to trap CP15 accesses and handle them at EL2, we
need to evaluate whether or not the condition flags are valid,
as an implementation is allowed to trap despite the condition
not being met.

Tagging the function as __hyp_text allows this. We still rely on
the cc_map array to be mapped at EL2 by virtue of being "const",
and the linker to only emit relative references.
