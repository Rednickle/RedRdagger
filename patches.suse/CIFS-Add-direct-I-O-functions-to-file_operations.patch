Subject: [PATCH] CIFS: Add direct I/O functions to file_operations
Git-commit: be4eb68846dc4450a9a4998d7c16d9f4955f9988
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
References: bsc#1144333

With direct read/write functions implemented, add them to file_operations.

Dircet I/O is used under two conditions:
1. When mounting with "cache=none", CIFS uses direct I/O for all user file
data transfer.
2. When opening a file with O_DIRECT, CIFS uses direct I/O for all data
transfer on this file.
