Subject: [PATCH] md: document lifetime of internal rdev pointer.
Git-commit: f2785b527cda46314805123ddcbc871655b7c4c4
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc4
References: bsc#1093023

The rdev pointer kept in the local 'config' for each for
raid1, raid10, raid4/5/6 has non-obvious lifetime rules.
Sometimes RCU is needed, sometimes a lock, something nothing.

Add documentation to explain this.
