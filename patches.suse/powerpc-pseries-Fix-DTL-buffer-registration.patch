Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries: Fix DTL buffer registration

References: bsc#1065729
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
Git-commit: db787af1b8a6b4be428ee2ea7d409dafcaa4a43c

When CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE is not set, we register the DTL
buffer for a cpu when the associated file under powerpc/dtl in debugfs
is opened. When doing so, we need to set the size of the buffer being
registered in the second u32 word of the buffer. This needs to be in big
endian, but we are not doing the conversion resulting in the below error
showing up in dmesg:

	dtl_start: DTL registration for cpu 0 (hw 0) failed with -4

Fix this in the obvious manner.

Fixes: 7c105b63bd98 ("powerpc: Add CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN kernel config option.")
