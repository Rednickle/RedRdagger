Subject: net: sched: fix use after free when tcf_chain_destroy is called
 multiple times
Patch-mainline: v4.13
Git-commit: 744a4cf63e528c29840f45811d6fb93fd129b87d
References: bsc#1056787

The goto_chain termination action takes a reference of a chain. In that
case, there is an issue when block_put is called tcf_chain_destroy
directly. The follo-up call of tcf_chain_put by goto_chain action free
works with memory that is already freed. This was caught by kasan:

[  220.337908] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in tcf_chain_put+0x1b/0x50

So allow tcf_chain_destroy to be called multiple times, free only in
case the reference count drops to 0.
