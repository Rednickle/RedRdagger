Subject: [PATCH] scsi: lpfc: Defer LS_ACC to FLOGI on point to point logins
Git-commit: 0a9e9687acaf6ac1198fd41f03d64f8b92e4515e
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc1
References: bsc#1118215

The current discovery state machine the driver treated FLOGI oddly.  When
point to point, an FLOGI is to be exchanged by the two ports, with the port
with the most significant WWN then proceeding with PLOGI.  The
implementation in the driver was keyed to closely with "what have I sent",
not with what has happened between the two endpoints. Thus, it blatantly
would ACC an FLOGI, but reject PLOGI's until it had its FLOGI ACC'd. The
problem is - the sending of FLOGI may be delayed for some reason, or the
response to FLOGI held off by the other side. In the failing situation the
other side sent an FLOGI, which was ACC'd, then sent PLOGIs which were then
rjt'd until the retry count for the PLOGIs were exceeded and the port gave
up. The FLOGI may have been very late in transmit, or the response held off
until the PLOGIs failed. Given the other port had the higher WWN, no PLOGIs
would occur and communication stopped.

Correct the situation by changing the FLOGI handling. Defer any response to
an FLOGI until the driver has sent its FLOGI as well. Then, upon either
completion of the sent FLOGI, or upon sending an ACC to a received FLOGI
(which may be received before or just after FLOGI was sent). the driver
will act on who has the higher WWN. if the other port does, the driver will
noop any handling of an FLOGI response (if outstanding) and wait for PLOGI.
If the local port does, the driver will transition to sending PLOGI and
will noop any action on responding to an FLOGI (if not yet received).

Fortunately, to implement this, it only took another state flag and
deferring any FLOGI response if the FLOGI has yet to be transmit. All
subsequent actions were already in place.
