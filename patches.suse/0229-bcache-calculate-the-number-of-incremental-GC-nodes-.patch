Subject: [PATCH] bcache: calculate the number of incremental GC nodes
 according to the total of btree nodes
Git-commit: 7f4a59de28137aae4316a58f501b599ac3b87395
Reference: bsc#1064232
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1

This patch base on "[PATCH] bcache: finish incremental GC".

Since incremental GC would stop 100ms when front side I/O comes, so when
there are many btree nodes, if GC only processes constant (100) nodes each
time, GC would last a long time, and the front I/Os would run out of the
buckets (since no new bucket can be allocated during GC), and I/Os be
blocked again.

So GC should not process constant nodes, but varied nodes according to the
number of btree nodes. In this patch, GC is divided into constant (100)
times, so when there are many btree nodes, GC can process more nodes each
time, otherwise GC will process less nodes each time (but no less than
MIN_GC_NODES).
