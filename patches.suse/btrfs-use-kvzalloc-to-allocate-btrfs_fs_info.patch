Subject: btrfs: use kvzalloc to allocate btrfs_fs_info
Patch-mainline: Submitted, 15 Feb 2018
References: bsc#1059336

The srcu_struct in btrfs_fs_infoa scales in size with NR_CPUS.  On
kernels built with NR_CPUS=8192, this can result in kmalloc failures
that prevent mounting.

There is work in progress to try to resolve this for every user of
srcu_struct but using kvzalloc will work around the failures until
that is complete.
