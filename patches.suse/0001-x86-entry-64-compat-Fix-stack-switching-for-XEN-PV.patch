Subject: [PATCH] x86/entry/64/compat: Fix stack switching for XEN PV

While in the native case entry into the kernel happens on the trampoline
stack, PV Xen kernels get entered with the current thread stack right
away. Hence source and destination stacks are identical in that case,
and special care is needed.

Other than in sync_regs() the copying done on the INT80 path isn't
NMI / #MC safe, as either of these events occurring in the middle of the
stack copying would clobber data on the (source) stack.

There is similar code in interrupt_entry() and nmi(), but there is no fixup
required because those code paths are unreachable in XEN PV guests.

[Juergen Gross: Applying the upstream patch to switch_to_thread_stack()
                would have been wrong, as only entry_INT80_compat() should
                be modified. For that purpose introduce a copy of
                switch_to_thread_stack() named switch_to_thread_stack_compat()
                and call that from entry_INT80_compat() instead.
                In order to keep the complexity as low as possible move
                the push of %rdi to entry_INT80_compat().]
