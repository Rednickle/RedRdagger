Subject: kgr: add objname to kgr_patch_fun struct
Patch-mainline: not yet, kgraft
References: fate#313296

Currently there is no link between a function supposed to be patched and
the parent object (that is a module or vmlinux) the function is located
in. Unfortunately it proves to be a limitation when ones to implement
some features or optimizations. Simply add an object name to
kgr_patch_fun struct. It is either a module name or NULL for vmlinux
object.

Also leave existing KGR_PATCH macro as is with NULL as a default object
name and add new KGR_PATCH_OBJ macro which allows to specify it.
