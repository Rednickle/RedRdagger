Subject: Set depth on low mem Radeon cards to 16 instead of 8.
Patch-mainline: Never
Date: Thu Feb 23 09:24:39 CET 2012
References: bnc #746883

  The Radeon driver reduces the framebuffer resolution to 8bpp if
  a device with less than 32 Mb VRAM is found. This causes the
  framebuffer to run in 8 bit paletted mode. For a text console this
  is not an issue as 256 different colors is more than one gets
  on a VGA text console.
  It is done to give X more memory to work with since the console memory
  is not freed but remains allocated while X is active.
  Still, running the fbdev Xserver driver - which we do during installation
  - will give applications an 8bit pseudo-color visual which doesn't look
  too pretty.
  We therefore limit the framebuffer bpp to 16 when memory is 24MB or lower
  and to 8 only if 8MB or less VRAM is found.
  This should be a reasonable compromise for us.
  This patch will most likely not ever make it upstream.
