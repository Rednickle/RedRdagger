Subject: drm/amd/display: Fix warnings on S3 resume
Git-commit: fcb4019e090b959dbcbfc7bbbc1ebd99c924fa11
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: FATE#326289 FATE#326079 FATE#326049 FATE#322398 FATE#326166

This is a followup to the following revert:

Rex Zhu    Revert "drm/amd/display: Match actual state during S3
           resume."

Three things needed to be addressed:

1. Potential memory leak on dc_state creation in atomic_check during
   s3 resume
2. Warnings are now seen in dmesg during S3 resume
3. Since dc_state is now created in atomic_check, what the reverted
   patch was addressing needs to be reevaluated.

This change addresses the above:

1. Since the suspend procedure calls drm_atomic_state_clear, our hook
   for releasing the dc_state is called. This frees it before
   atomic_check creates it during resume. The leak does not occur.

2. The dc_crtc/plane_state references kept by the atomic states need to
   be released before calling atomic_check, which warns if they are
   non-null. This is because atomic_check is responsible for creating
   the dc_*_states. This is a special case for S3 resume, since the
   atomic state duplication that occurs during suspend also copies a
   reference to the dc_*_states.

3. See 2. comments are also updated to reflect this.
