Subject: x86/MCE: Initialize mce.bank in the case of a fatal error in
 mce_no_way_out()
Git-commit: d28af26faa0b1daf3c692603d46bc4687c16f19e
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc6
References: bsc#1114279

Internal injection testing crashed with a console log that said:

  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 7: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 0: bd80000000100134

This caused a lot of head scratching because the MCACOD (bits 15:0) of
that status is a signature from an L1 data cache error. But Linux says
that it found it in "Bank 0", which on this model CPU only reports L1
instruction cache errors.

The answer was that Linux doesn't initialize "m->bank" in the case that
it finds a fatal error in the mce_no_way_out() pre-scan of banks. If
this was a local machine check, then this partially initialized struct
mce is being passed to mce_panic().

Fix is simple: just initialize m->bank in the case of a fatal error.
