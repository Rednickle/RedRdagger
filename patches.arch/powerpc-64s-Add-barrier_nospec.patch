Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64s: Add barrier_nospec

References: bsc#1068032, bsc#1080157
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
Git-commit: a6b3964ad71a61bb7c61d80a60bea7d42187b2eb

A no-op form of ori (or immediate of 0 into r31 and the result stored
in r31) has been re-tasked as a speculation barrier. The instruction
only acts as a barrier on newer machines with appropriate firmware
support. On older CPUs it remains a harmless no-op.

Implement barrier_nospec using this instruction.

mpe: The semantics of the instruction are believed to be that it
prevents execution of subsequent instructions until preceding branches
have been fully resolved and are no longer executing speculatively.
There is no further documentation available at this time.
