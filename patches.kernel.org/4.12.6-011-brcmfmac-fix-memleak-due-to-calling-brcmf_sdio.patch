Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: fix memleak due to calling
 brcmf_sdiod_sgtable_alloc() twice
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: 4.12.6
Git-commit: 5f5d03143de5e0c593da4ab18fc6393c2815e108

commit 5f5d03143de5e0c593da4ab18fc6393c2815e108 upstream.

Due to a bugfix in wireless tree and the commit mentioned below a merge
was needed which went haywire. So the submitted change resulted in the
function brcmf_sdiod_sgtable_alloc() being called twice during the probe
thus leaking the memory of the first call.

Fixes: 4d7928959832 ("brcmfmac: switch to new platform data")
