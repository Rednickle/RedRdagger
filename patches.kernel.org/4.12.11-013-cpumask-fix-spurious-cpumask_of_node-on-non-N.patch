Subject: [PATCH] cpumask: fix spurious cpumask_of_node() on non-NUMA
 multi-node configs
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: 4.12.11
Git-commit: b339752d054fb32863418452dff350a1086885b1

commit b339752d054fb32863418452dff350a1086885b1 upstream.

When !NUMA, cpumask_of_node(@node) equals cpu_online_mask regardless of
@node.  The assumption seems that if !NUMA, there shouldn't be more than
one node and thus reporting cpu_online_mask regardless of @node is
correct.  However, that assumption was broken years ago to support
DISCONTIGMEM and whether a system has multiple nodes or not is
separately controlled by NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES.

This means that, on a system with !NUMA && NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES,
cpumask_of_node() will report cpu_online_mask for all possible nodes,
indicating that the CPUs are associated with multiple nodes which is an
impossible configuration.

This bug has been around forever but doesn't look like it has caused any
noticeable symptoms.  However, it triggers a WARN recently added to
workqueue to verify NUMA affinity configuration.

Fix it by reporting empty cpumask on non-zero nodes if !NUMA.
