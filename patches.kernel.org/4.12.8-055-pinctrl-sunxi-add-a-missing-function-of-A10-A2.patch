Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: sunxi: add a missing function of A10/A20 pinctrl
 driver
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: 4.12.8
Git-commit: d81ece747d8727bb8b1cfc9a20dbe62f09a4e35a

commit d81ece747d8727bb8b1cfc9a20dbe62f09a4e35a upstream.

The PH16 pin has a function with mux id 0x5, which is the DET pin of the
"sim" (smart card reader) IP block.

This function is missing in old versions of A10/A20 SoCs' datasheets and
user manuals, so it's also missing in the old drivers. The newest A10
Datasheet V1.70 and A20 Datasheet V1.41 contain this pin function, and
it's discovered during implementing R40 pinctrl driver.

Add it to the driver. As we now merged A20 pinctrl driver to the A10
one, we need to only fix the A10 driver now.

Fixes: f2821b1ca3a2 ("pinctrl: sunxi: Move Allwinner A10 pinctrl
driver to a driver of its own")
