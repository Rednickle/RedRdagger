Subject: [PATCH] tcp_bbr: cut pacing rate only if filled pipe
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: 4.12.6
Git-commit: 4aea287e90dd61a48268ff2994b56f9799441b62

[ Upstream commit 4aea287e90dd61a48268ff2994b56f9799441b62 ]

In bbr_set_pacing_rate(), which decides whether to cut the pacing
rate, there was some code that considered exiting STARTUP to be
equivalent to the notion of filling the pipe (i.e.,
bbr_full_bw_reached()). Specifically, as the code was structured,
exiting STARTUP and going into PROBE_RTT could cause us to cut the
pacing rate down to something silly and low, based on whatever
bandwidth samples we've had so far, when it's possible that all of
them have been small app-limited bandwidth samples that are not
representative of the bandwidth available in the path. (The code was
correct at the time it was written, but the state machine changed
without this spot being adjusted correspondingly.)
