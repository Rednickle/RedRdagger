Subject: [PATCH] imx-serial: RX DMA startup latency
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: 4.12.2
Git-commit: 4dec2f119e86f9c91e60cdd8f0cc057452e331a9

commit 4dec2f119e86f9c91e60cdd8f0cc057452e331a9 upstream.

18a4208 introduced a change to reduce the RX DMA latency on the first reception
when the serial port was opened for reading. However it was claiming a hardirq
unsafe lock after a hardirq safe lock which is not allowed and causes lockdep
to complain verbosely.

This patch changes the code to always start RX DMA earlier, instead of
relying on the flags used to open the serial port removing the code that
was looking for the serial file flags.
