Subject: [PATCH] dccp: fix a memleak that dccp_ipv6 doesn't put reqsk properly
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: 4.12.6
Git-commit: 0c2232b0a71db0ac1d22f751aa1ac0cadb950fd2

[ Upstream commit 0c2232b0a71db0ac1d22f751aa1ac0cadb950fd2 ]

In dccp_v6_conn_request, after reqsk gets alloced and hashed into
ehash table, reqsk's refcnt is set 3. one is for req->rsk_timer,
one is for hlist, and the other one is for current using.

The problem is when dccp_v6_conn_request returns and finishes using
reqsk, it doesn't put reqsk. This will cause reqsk refcnt leaks and
reqsk obj never gets freed.

Jianlin found this issue when running dccp_memleak.c in a loop, the
system memory would run out.

dccp_memleak.c:
  int s1 = socket(PF_INET6, 6, IPPROTO_IP);
  bind(s1, &sa1, 0x20);
  listen(s1, 0x9);
  int s2 = socket(PF_INET6, 6, IPPROTO_IP);
  connect(s2, &sa1, 0x20);
  close(s1);
  close(s2);

This patch is to put the reqsk before dccp_v6_conn_request returns,
just as what tcp_conn_request does.
